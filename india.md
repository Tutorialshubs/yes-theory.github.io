## Technical support  
### I get an error when I try to join the group.  
Facebook seems to have a problem and on some devices it's not possible to join.  
There is a possible solution for Smartphones:  
You will need Chrome or Firefox Focus  
* Click on the link
* Click on the three dots at the top right
* Click on "Open with..."
* Choose Firefox Focus or Chrome
* Click on the three dots on the top right
* Click on "Request desktop site" or "Desktop site"
* Sometimes it helps to close the site and to try again  

Also try to join on another device it will sync across devices.
